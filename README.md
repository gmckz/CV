## Gemma McKenzie

I am a self-motivated, creative and mission-driven problem solver with a keen eye for detail hoping to thrive and develop my software development skills at a company that is leveraging their tech for good. My experience working in the education and charity sectors highlighted how these industries could be more impactful by embracing new technology. The opportunity to collaborate on the development of an online training platform at a previous role sparked a passion for designing and building web apps, which eventually led me to a career change into tech.

## Skills

#### Communication

I am experienced in communicating ideas to a diverse range of people, from subject experts to 6-7 year olds. During my time working at the Anna Freud Center, I worked on a project to build a new online training platform which involved communicating with software developer consultants to brief them on our requirements and giving feedback when new features did not meet our specifications. Utilising my communication skills in this project meant we were able to quickly launch a high quality product in just a few months in response to demand for online training in the wake of the pandemic. This experience proved to be valuable during my time at Makers as I was able to appreciate the need for strong communication from both sides, both as a client and as a software developer.

#### Attention to detail

I had an excellent opportunity to refine my attention to detail skills while working at Pearson. A large part of my roles as subject coordinator and subject leader was performing quality checks on assessment materials such as exam papers after each stage of amendments. On many occasions I was able to promptly spot spelling errors, typos or mistakes in diagrams made by typesetters and ensure these were amended before final sign off. My contribution resulted in the publication of more than 140 assessment materials that met OfQual standards and avoided any issues that would have resulted if errors were found in materials by students or teachers on the day of the exam. My strength in this skill was an asset during group projects as on a couple of occasions I was able to spot where a team member's code might cause bugs in our product while reviewing their pull requests.

#### Problem Solving

Studying Physics at the University of Nottingham equipped me with excellent problem solving skills through practice deriving theoretical principles and executing experiments in lab based projects. These skills were invaluable during my time at Makers as I was able to approach project specifications and coding problems in a methodical and thorough manner by breaking the task down into smaller manageable chunks and embracing test driven development practices. During tech test week we were tasked with building a bank account app. I successfully utilised my problem solving skills to break down the problem into tickets, seek clarification on edge cases and come up with a clear design. As a result my solution checked all the areas I was being assessed on in its first submission and minimal refactoring was required.

## Education

-   A 12 week part-time course (50 hours) where I learned course theory on how charities operate, communicate strategically, generate income and deliver programmes effectively.
-   I also gained volunteer management skills through successful completion of a fundraising challenge in which I recruited and managed a team of volunteers for a fundraising event that raised £1886 for Child.org

#### University of Nottingham (Sep. 2012 to Jun. 2015)

-   Physics BSc 2:2

#### Nower Hill High School & Sixth Form

-   A Levels: Physics, Philosophy & Ethics, Mathematics (AAB)
-   13 GCSEs (A\*/A) including Maths and English

## Hobbies

When I’m not working on programming projects you’ll probably find me in a quiet corner burning through my towering to-read pile, or working on a knitting or crochet project with a good audiobook or netflix show for company. Occasionally you’ll find me outside my cosy cave exploring the Chiltern hills near my home.
