## Gemma McKenzie

I am a self-motivated, creative and mission-driven problem solver with a keen eye for detail hoping to thrive and develop my software development skills at a company that is leveraging their tech for good. My experience working in the education and charity sectors highlighted how these industries could be more impactful by embracing new technology. The opportunity to collaborate on the development of an online training platform at a previous role sparked a passion for designing and building web apps, which eventually led me to a career change into tech.

## Skills

# TODO

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.

Here's an example

#### Communication

I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

-   I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
-   I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
-   I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
-   A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill

communication, collaboration,

## Education

#### Charity Fast-track Foundation Course (Nov. 2019 to Jan. 2020)

-   A 12 week part-time course (50 hours) where I learned course theory on how charities operate, communicate strategically, generate income and deliver programmes effectively.
-   I also gained volunteer management skills through successful completion of a fundraising challenge in which I recruited and managed a team of volunteers for a fundraising event that raised £1886 for Child.org

#### University of Nottingham (Sep. 2012 to Jun. 2015)

-   Physics BSc
-   2:2

#### Nower Hill High School & Sixth Form

-   A Levels: Physics, Philosophy & Ethics, Mathematics
-   AAB
-   13 GCSEs (A\*/A) including Maths and English

## Hobbies

When I’m not working on programming projects you’ll probably find me in a quiet corner burning through my towering to-read pile, or working on a knitting or crochet project with a good audiobook or netflix show for company. Occasionally you’ll find me outside my cosy cave exploring the Chiltern hills near my home.
