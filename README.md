## Gemma McKenzie

I am a self-motivated, creative and mission-driven problem solver with a keen eye for detail hoping to thrive and develop my software development skills at a company that is leveraging their tech for good. My experience working in the education and charity sectors highlighted how these industries could be more impactful by embracing new technology. The opportunity to collaborate on the development of an online training platform at a previous role sparked a passion for designing and building web apps, which eventually led me to a career change into tech.

## Hobbies

When I’m not working on programming projects you’ll probably find me in a quiet corner burning through my towering to-read pile, or working on a knitting or crochet project with a good audiobook or netflix show for company. Occasionally you’ll find me outside my cosy cave exploring the Chiltern hills near my home.
